# Takes real-world D-ATIS's and creates a custom vATIS preset.

## Features

- Works with any facility that has a D-ATIS.
- Can fetch the D-ATIS for all airports in a profile.
- Adds appropiate contractions so the voice atis reads it correctly.
- Listens for updates to the D-ATIS at an interval of your choosing, notifying you when it changes.
  - The interval can be set to a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 60 minutes. By default, from the H+53 -> H+03 it will check it every 2 minutes as this is when the ATIS is most likely to change. This can be disabled.
